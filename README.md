# Project-2
This Program uses an input file (mp2accept.txt) containing data about multiple students (which school they are applying to,
what their GPA is, their SAT and ACT scores, and whether or not they were affiliated with alumnus) to determine whether or not they
were admitted to the school they were applying to. The results are printed on an output file (output.txt).*/
